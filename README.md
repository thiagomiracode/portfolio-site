## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 Integrated AI Assistant
The portfolio's highlight is an intelligent Chatbot acting as my virtual assistant. It is configured to answer questions about:
* Services and technology stack.

* Direct contact guidance (WhatsApp/Email).

### 🌍 Dynamic Internationalization (i18n)
A seamless language switching system that updates the entire UI without page reloads. Using **Context API**, it ensures that all components (Hero, Projects, Chat, Footer) synchronize instantly.
